        I have extensive experience as a software engineer, with a focus on
        implementing CI/CD and using agile methodologies like SCRUM and DevOps.
        I am highly passionate about both hardware and open-source software, and
        I am always looking for new and exciting projects to work on. I believe
        that my combination of technical skills and creative problem-solving
        abilities make me an asset to any development team.
