      <h3>Software Engineer - EPAM Anywhere (Feb 2022 - Present)</h3>
      <P>
        In my current role at EPAM Anywhere, I have been working on refactoring
        an e-commerce web application from a version developed with vanilla JS
        and JQuery to a new version built with React JS. The new application
        implements a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) using Java Spring, SAP
        Hybris, and React, and has already been well-received by our clients. I
        am confident that my technical skills and ability to work well within a
        team have been major contributors to this project's success.
